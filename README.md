# Smart Parking Management System  
### Data Structures Project (TCS-302)

## Team Members  
- Kartikey Kashyap  
- Parash Rastogi  
- Aman Kumar  

## Project Overview  
The Smart Parking Management System is a C++ and Qt-based project designed to efficiently manage parking spaces using data structures.  
It automates key processes such as vehicle registration, slot allocation, billing, and reporting, providing a structured and efficient solution for modern parking management.  
The project focuses on optimizing performance, reducing manual errors, and enhancing usability through clear modular design.

## Key Features  
- Vehicle Management: Handles vehicle entry, exit, and registration details.  
- Parking Slot Management: Allocates and releases slots dynamically based on availability.  
- Fare Calculation and Billing: Calculates parking charges based on duration and vehicle type.  
- Search and Navigation: Allows quick searching of slots and vehicles using efficient algorithms.  
- Reporting and Analytics: Generates summaries such as total revenue, occupancy rate, and parking trends.  
- Error Handling and Validation: Ensures input correctness and prevents runtime issues.  
- File Handling: Stores and retrieves data using local file management for persistence.  
- GUI Integration (Qt): Designed for smooth integration with a graphical interface.
